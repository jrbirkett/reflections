How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped see the big because diff enabled the user to be able to compare the new version of the program with the old version. The user could use this information to figure out why the old version worked and the new version didn't work. 


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?


Having access to all previous versions of a file could be helpful because you could easily go back and check older files to try and find out errors you may have made.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: don't save unnecessary versions. Cons: you have to manually choose to save.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately? 

Git is geared towards programming applications,
while Google Docs is for other uses.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all the different commits
git diff allows you to compare commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

With version control, you are able to quickly
go back to versions that work.
